# REPLACE WITH YOUR APP NAME

This is the Final assessment template for CASA0014 - Please use this template and edit the relevant sections to personalise.
This section has a short introduction to what the application is

## Use this README File 

Use this section to show us what your Mobile App is about.   Include a Screenshot to the App, link to the various frameworks you've used. Include your presentation video here that shows off your Mobile App.   Emojis are also fun to include ðŸ“± ðŸ˜„

Look at some other Flutter Apps online and see how they use there README File.  Good examples are:

- https://github.com/miickel/flutter_particle_clock
- https://github.com/Tarikul711/flutter-food-delivery-app-ui    
- https://github.com/mohak1283/Instagram-Clone


## Include A Section That Tells Developers How To Install The App

Include a section that gives intructions on how to install the app or run it in Flutter.  What versions of the plugins are you assuming?  Maybe define a licence

##  Contact Details

Having Contact Details is also good as it shows people how to get in contact with you if they'd like to contribute to the app.

## Overview

**BlueGuardian** is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to monitor and visualize river water quality in real-time using water sensors and server services. The app empowers users to interact with live environmental data, aiming to protect and improve our connected aquatic environments.

This project is part of the UCL CASA0015 Mobile Systems coursework, demonstrating comprehensive skills in mobile application development, IoT integration, cloud communication, and user-centered interaction design.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Splash Screen** with animations.
- **Multi-View Navigation**:
  - Home Grid (select rivers)
  - Real-time Map View (with dynamic sensor markers)
  - Sensor Data History List
  - Graphical Visualization over Time
  - MQTT Server Settings Page
- **Real-time MQTT Communication**:
  - Subscribe to sensor data topics.
  - Receive and decode water quality parameters.
- **Physical Device Interaction**:
  - Reads parameters like Dissolved Oxygen, TDS, Turbidity, pH, Temperature, and Coliform levels.
- **Historical Data Management**:
  - Request and visualize past water quality data.
  - Smooth time series browsing and graphs.
- **Cloud-Connected Architecture**:
  - Utilizes MQTT Broker for low-latency IoT communication.
- **User Customization**:
  - Change MQTT server IP and Port through app settings.

## Development Environment

- Flutter version: 3.7.12
- Dart version: 3.3.0
- Dart version: 2.19.6 
- DevTools version:  2.20.1
- Tested on: iOS 14(iPhone 13 Pro Max), iOS 18(iPhone15 Pro Max)
- Major dependencies:
  - `flutter_map` (Map display)
  - `flutter_map_marker_popup` (Map marker interaction)
  - `fl_chart` (Line charts)
  - `mqtt_client` (MQTT protocol support)
  - `shared_preferences` (Persistent local storage)
  - `intl` (Date and Time formatting)

---

## Key Flutter Widgets Used

- `GridView`, `ListView`, `Stack`, `GestureDetector`
- `AnimatedOpacity` (animations)
- `Card`, `ElevatedButton`, `TextField`
- `FlutterMap`, `FlChart`
- `SharedPreferences`

All interfaces adapt responsively to different screen sizes for a consistent user experience across devices.

## User Journey

- Launch App âž” Splash Screen âž” Home Page with rivers list âž”
- Select a river âž” Real-time Map with live sensor markers âž”
- Tap on markers to view sensor readings âž”
- Access Sensor Data History âž” Browse past week's readings âž”
- Visualize historical trends via interactive Graphs âž”
- Customize server settings if needed âž” Real-time monitoring and proactive river protection.

---

## Data Management and Collection

The app continuously subscribes to real-time MQTT topics to collect Dissolved Oxygen (DO), TDS, Turbidity, pH, Temperature, and Coliform data from connected river sensors.  
Users can also request historical data for specific dates. Data are visualized both in list view and dynamic charts for clear trend analysis.

---

## GitHub Development Workflow

The GitHub repository maintains a continuous and detailed commit history to reflect iterative development. Each feature addition, UI improvement, and bug fix is committed separately to demonstrate progress clearly.

âœ… Version control practices followed: branching, progressive commits, meaningful messages.

## MQTT Topics Used

| Topic         | Purpose                              |
|:--------------|:-------------------------------------|
| `AQ/send`     | Publish real-time sensor readings    |
| `AQ/request`  | Request historical sensor data       |
| `AQ/response` | Receive requested historical data    |

## Problem Statement

Many urban rivers are under-monitored despite rising pollution threats. Existing professional monitoring systems are expensive, complex, and inaccessible to local communities. 

**BlueGuardian** provides a low-cost, mobile-accessible system for real-time water quality tracking, aiming to foster community-driven environmental protection initiatives.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add user authentication and profile tracking.
- Enable sensor fault detection and alert mechanisms.
- Integrate weather APIs to correlate water quality with environmental conditions.
- Support offline data caching for unstable network conditions.
